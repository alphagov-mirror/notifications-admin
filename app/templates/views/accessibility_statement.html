    How we tested this service
  </h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    The parts of the website used to send text messages, emails and letters were last tested on 15 July 2020. The emails we send out, the web pages users see when they are sent a file by Notify and a sample letter PDF were last tested on 11th March 2019. Both tests were carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC).
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    We decided which pages to test based on the most common tasks that GOV.UK Notify users need to complete. We also tested a sample of pages with common user interface components.
  </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">
    This statement was prepared on 23 September 2020. It was last reviewed on 22 October 2020.
